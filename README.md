# iterBotRepo

This is the implementation phase for CSC 492.

We previously created the Requirements/Specifications/Design documents, and are now (as of feb 2018) implementing the design.

The project consists of "walking" creatures created from various shapes and joints. The objective is to simulate an environment where the beings will continually get better at moving in a specific direction in a certain set up terrain.  Through the process of iteration and mutation of the creature's genetic makeup, we are able to coerce the creatures to gain advantageous traits while losing disadvantagous ones.

This proceedure is entirely randomized, with the bots being neither designed or pruned by any engineer. The implemented algorithm will simply pick the best bots from a generation and create new generations to test out of those creatures.

The entire folder contained here is the whole of the Unity Project.
