# iterBotRepo

This project reflects the continued development of iterbot, a Genetic Algorithm Unity Project.

The project consists of "walking" creatures created from various shapes and joints. The objective is to simulate an environment where the beings will continually get better at moving in a specific direction in a simulated terrain.  Through the process of iteration and mutation of the creature's genetic makeup, the creatures gain advantageous traits while losing disadvantagous ones.

The algorithms used are based on basic genetic models and developed for this specific project. The implemented algorithm will simply pick the best bots from a generation and create new generations from them.
